#Lightning Talks  
“Lightning Talks” are a tradition in open-source technical conferences (and maybe others?). The idea is that people can do a quick talk about a topic of their choice – much lower pressure than a “real” talk – but gives folks a chance to show off something they have worked on.

For this class, it’s a chance to us to learn a bit about each-other and maybe something new about Python.

Each of you will be required to give one lightning talk at some point during the course.

Lightning Talks Requirements
* 5 minutes each (including setup) - no kidding!  
* Every student will give one  
* Purposes: introduce yourself, share interests, show Python applications  
* Any topic you like that is related to Python – according to you!
